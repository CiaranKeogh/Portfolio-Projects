Primary Color: Olive Drab (#4A5D23 or similar)  
A muted, military green evokes the rugged, wartime feel of tanks and ground forces, a key element of War Thunder. It’s versatile for backgrounds or accents.

Secondary Color: Gunmetal Gray (#2A3439)  
This dark, steely gray ties into the metallic aesthetic of tanks, planes, and ships, grounding the design in the game’s industrial vibe. Great for headers, text, or UI elements.

Accent Color: Burnt Orange (#CC5500)  
A bold, fiery orange can represent explosions, engine heat, or dynamic action, adding energy to buttons, highlights, or call-to-action elements.

Neutral Base: Off-White or Light Gray (#E8ECEF)  
A clean, slightly weathered off-white or light gray keeps the site readable and balanced, mimicking aged paper or a tactical map. Ideal for backgrounds or text contrast.

Highlight/Support Color: Deep Blue (#1A3C5A)  
Inspired by naval warfare and aviation skies, a rich blue can subtly nod to the game’s air and sea components, working well for links or secondary accents.
