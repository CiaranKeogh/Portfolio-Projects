War Thunder Tactics: Product Requirements Document
Project Overview
War Thunder Tactics will be a community-driven website where players can share, view, and vote on optimal routes, power positions, and strategies for the Realistic Battles Ground game mode in War Thunder. The platform will leverage crowdsourced knowledge to help players improve their gameplay through visual tactical information.

2. Route Creation & Power Position Marking
•	Drawing tools to create vehicle routes on maps
•	Color-coding for different vehicle types (light tanks, heavy tanks, SPGs, etc.)
•	Ability to add waypoints with timestamps (early-game, mid-game, late-game positions)
•	Option to include vehicle specifications when creating routes
•	Ability to mark and highlight strategic positions on maps
•	Position categorization (sniping spots, cover positions, ambush points, etc.)
•	Effectiveness ratings for different vehicle classes at each position
•	Line-of-sight visualization from power positions
•	Ability to add iconography such as adjustable cones of fire, friendly / enemy tanks, free text that can be dragged onto the map. 
4. Community Voting System
•	Upvote/downvote functionality for routes and positions
•	Sorting options (top-rated, newest, most controversial)
