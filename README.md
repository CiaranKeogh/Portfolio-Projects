A little home for the various tinkerings and broken code that hopefully amounts to something resembling a solution for some problem! 

## Projects

### [Project 1: War Thunder Tactics](./project-1)
War Thunder Tactics is a community-driven website where players can share, view, and vote on optimal routes, power positions, and strategies for the Realistic Battles Ground game mode in War Thunder. The platform will leverage crowdsourced knowledge to help players improve their gameplay through visual tactical information.
